# work-Portafolio
## description
My motivation to do this project is learning more about html and css, experiment with different codes and improve my skills. I built this project to compare the different code that can be used to make the code more organized and clean. I challenged my imagination and compared the different uses of my code.
I learned new types of codes that replaces the existing one on the project
My project is a web page that includes my portafolio with an intruduction of myself and my work, also my social media so I can be contacted through my page.
